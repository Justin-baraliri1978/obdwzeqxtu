# üí• Jax Miller: Stunt History & Vision for "Uppercut" üí•

---

## Introduction: Blood, Sweat, and the Silver Screen

Alright, listen up. Name's Jax Miller. For twenty years, I've been chasing gravity, dancing with fire, and turning controlled chaos into movie magic. I don't just do stunts; I live them. Every fall, every crash, every punch is a story told without words.

This file isn't just a list of gigs. It's a testament to a career built on guts, precision, and the unwavering commitment to making the impossible look real ‚Äì and keeping everyone safe while we do it. When I heard about "Uppercut," something clicked. This isn't just another project; it feels like the one where everything aligns. Raw, gritty, and demanding authenticity in every frame. That's my kind of canvas.

## Why "Uppercut"? The Call to Authenticity

The script for "Uppercut" screams realism. It's not about flashy, physics-defying acrobatics (though I can do those too). It's about the impact, the struggle, the raw physicality of conflict. This demands a stunt team that understands weight, momentum, pain (simulated, of course), and the psychological truth of a fight. My experience is perfectly tuned for this frequency. We're not selling fantasy; we're delivering visceral truth.

## Core Stunt Expertise

My repertoire is broad, forged in fire and concrete. For "Uppercut," the focus will be on bringing these specific skills to bear:

### üöó Vehicle Dynamics & Destruction
   Precision driving in high-speed chase sequences.
   Controlled rollovers, collisions, and vehicle-to-vehicle impacts.
   Creating complex vehicular choreography that serves narrative beats.

### ü§∏ High-Impact Falls & Hard Hits
   Safe execution of falls from significant heights (buildings, structures).
   Training actors and performers in realistic reaction to impacts.
   Designing and implementing wire-assisted falls for enhanced safety and control.

### üî• Fire Gags & Pyrotechnics Integration
   Full and partial body burns (with state-of-the-art safety).
   Integrating practical fire effects into action sequences seamlessly.

### üëä Combat Choreography & Brawls
   Developing hard-hitting, believable fight sequences that tell a story.
   Training actors for camera-ready, impactful punches, kicks, and grappling.
   Designing complex multi-person brawls that feel chaotic but are meticulously controlled.

## Selected Career Highlights: Scars & Stories

Every job leaves a mark, whether it's a physical ache or a lesson learned. Here are a few moments that stand out ‚Äì times we pushed the envelope and delivered something truly unforgettable:

   "Concrete Jungle" (2018): Designed and executed the 7-story freefall sequence where the protagonist crashes through multiple awnings. Challenge: Managing variables like wind and complex breakaway materials while ensuring actor safety on wires. Result: Nominated for a major stunt award.
   "Inferno Road" (2020): Coordinated and performed the full-body burn while running through a collapsing structure. Challenge: Sustaining the burn for an extended take and navigating unpredictable environmental factors. Result: A signature, iconic shot for the film.
   "The Gauntlet" (2022): Led the design and execution of the 5-minute, single-take rooftop chase sequence involving multiple performers, jumps between buildings, and a controlled crane fall. Challenge: Unprecedented logistical complexity and timing requirements across multiple departments. Result: Widely praised for its seamless, breathless intensity.
   "Steel Heart" (2023): Oversaw the main vehicular climax, featuring 15 simultaneous car crashes and a bridge jump with a practical vehicle. Challenge: Choreographing mass destruction with pinpoint accuracy and ensuring all vehicles landed safely in designated zones. Result: Delivered unprecedented scale and realism for the finale.

## Approach for "Uppercut": Precision, Impact, & Story

For "Uppercut," my focus is tripartite:

1.  Precision: Every fall, every hit, every vehicular maneuver must be planned to the millimeter. We analyze scripts, storyboard religiously, pre-visualize complex sequences, and rehearse until muscle memory takes over.
2.  Impact: The action must feel real. We use camera angles, sound design collaboration, and performer training to maximize the visceral punch of every stunt. The audience should wince, feel the weight, and understand the stakes.
3.  Story: Stunts aren't just spectacle; they are critical plot points. We work hand-in-hand with the director, writers, and actors to ensure the action sequences escalate tension, reveal character, and drive the narrative forward.

Safety is the bedrock of everything. There are no shortcuts. We use the best gear, employ the most rigorous protocols, and foster an environment where safety concerns are always voiced and addressed without hesitation.

## Vision for "Uppercut" Stunts

I see "Uppercut" as an opportunity to showcase the raw beauty and brutality of human struggle through action.

   Fight Scenes: Forget hyper-choreographed martial arts. Think messy, desperate brawls. Sweat, blood, struggle for dominance. Every punch lands with visible force.
   Chases: Gritty, low-to-the-ground vehicular action. Narrow escapes, unexpected obstacles, damage that feels earned.
   Falls: Not graceful descents, but hard, jarring impacts that look like they hurt (because they would).

This film demands authenticity, and my team and I are built for it. We're ready to bring the necessary level of experience, creativity, and ironclad safety protocols to make the action in "Uppercut" legendary.
